## Decentralized Peer-to-peer Cloud

The Internet is owned by the people.
`compute` / `store` / `network`

### Storage

- Zdb = Zero Database, operating in an "append only" manner, periodically "compacting" the data, to remove what's no longer needed
- Zdbfs = Zdb Filesystem (single node only)
- Zstor solution for spreading data across multiple nodes (Erasure Encoding: With basic redundancy, four extra copies would be needed => same failure tolerance using less than half the space needed for the original data)
- QSFS = Quantum Safe Filesystem, TF's flagship storage solution

### Compute = process the data

- ThreeFold Compute Primitives
- Zmachine = lightweight virtual machine (VM)
- Flist = next generation container format which extends the industry standard Docker container concept in an efficient and secure way
- Kubernetes = industry standard container orchestration system, it's used to manage many of the largest and most complex cloud deployments

### Network

## Decentralized Autonomous Organization
- Decentralized = Online, global, uncensorable.
- Autonomous = Self-governing.
- Organization = Coordination & collaboration around shared objectives.

### Summary
- organizational form that is fully manifested in software and not bound to any location, state, and government.
- with the interest in the blockchain technology, is moving into the spectrum of digital products
- promises to be a flexible, favorable and transparent form of organization.

### Components and properties
- Autonomy => blochain
- Currency => own currency, token
- Proposals => any member of the organization can submit and vote
- Transparency => capturing all aspects and processes on the blockchain
- Vote and consensus => agree on a consensus to determine the state of the blockchain
- External Contractor => external service providers from the “central world” are probably unavoidable

### Unexplained questions
- statelessness and legal certainty: risk of regulation and boycotting from classical parties (governments, banks, corporations).
- faulty source code or technical risks like the 51% attack

## ThreeFold DAO

### Layer 2 = ecosystem security layer
- only 1 blockchain with 100 validators, secures the multiple Layer 1 networks.

### Layer 1 = internet of blockchains layer
- ultimate scale because of thousands or millions of blockchains

### Layer 0 = the IT capacity layer
- cloud computing layer
- provide compute, storage and network resources to L1 and L2
