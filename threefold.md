## Decentralized Autonomous Organization

- Decentralized = Online, global, uncensorable.
- Autonomous = Self-governing.
- Organization = Coordination & collaboration around shared objectives.



### Layer 2 = ecosystem security layer
- only 1 blockchain with 100 validators, secures the multiple Layer 1 networks.

### Layer 1 = internet of blockchains layer
- ultimate scale because of thousands or millions of blockchains

### Layer 0 = the IT capacity layer
- cloud computing layer
- provide compute, storage and network resources to L1 and L2

## Decentralized Peer-to-peer Cloud

the Internet is owned by the people.
compute / store / network capacity

### Storage
Zdb = Zero Database
	operating in an "append only" manner, periodically "compacting" the data, to remove what's no longer needed
Zdbfs = Zdb Filesystem ( single node only)
Zstor solution for spreading data across multiple nodes
	Erasure Encoding: With basic redundancy, four extra copies would be needed 
	same failure tolerance using less than half the space needed for the original data
QSFS = Quantum Safe Filesystem, TF's flagship storage solution

### Compute = process the data
ThreeFold Compute Primitives
Zmachine = lightweight virtual machine (VM)
Flist = next generation container format which extends the industry standard Docker container concept in an efficient and secure way
Kubernetes = industry standard container orchestration system,	it's used to manage many of the largest and most complex cloud deployments

### Network
