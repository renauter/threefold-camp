## Cosmos SDK

The Cosmos SDK is written in Golang based on certain design considerations to allow for the customization of modules, however, expanding across many programming languages is crucial to growing developer adoption. Ultimately supporting the greater goal of enabling an Internet of Blockchains — or The Interchain — to support a plethora of implementations and capabilities connected by the Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC)

## IBC

IBC = INTER-BLOCKCHAIN COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL

## CosmWasm

CosmWasm, a project enabling WebAssembly (WASM) virtual machines (VMs) in the Cosmos SDK

Wasm = Web Assembly

Multi-Chain Contracts = Different Chain, Same Contract

CosmWasm is designed and built from the ground-up to be a multi-chain solution for smart contracts.
As it comes from the Cosmos ecosystem, it is designed for networks of blockchains, rather than siloed chains.
